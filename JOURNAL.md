I've always wanted to make one of those cyberdeck-y pelican case computers, you know the ones. But I'd need a keyboard that fits, preferibly laptop sized. I could get a 60% keyboard, but then I'd have less buttons or a mouse. If only there was a perfect keyboard with big clickly keys, enough buttons to suit a dev, and a way of moving the mouse without taking up too much space. Well there is! One problem, It is on the thinkpad T61. Doesn't use USB like any normal keyboard, instead it uses whatever ribbon cable lenovo decided to use. So I am basically going to make an adapter for the Thinkpad T61 keyboard to USB.
